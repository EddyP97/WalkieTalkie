This repository contains Python code for a semester project in TTM4115 where we made a walkie talkie that communicates over MQTT.
We use pyAudio to record and play audio messages and are able store the audio files as .wav files for later listening. In addition there is functinality to have text-to-speech for giving the user audio feedback on controlling the walkie talkie.
